# Loan Pay-off Predictor

This Project is used to analyze given data to predict if the loan case will be paid off or not by building a classifier using Machine Learning.
A historical dataset from previous loan applications was loaded, the data was cleaned, and different Classification Algorithm were applied on the data. 
This Project uses various Machine Learning Techniques and different Classification Algorithms to train models for predicting result based on a training data. 
The models' accuracy are then evaluated based on three different evaluation metrics using a testing data.

The Classification Algorithms used to train Models in this Project are:

- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

The Evaluation Metrics used to evaluate the Models are:

- Jaccard Score
- F1-Score
- Log Loss
